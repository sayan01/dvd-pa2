# Data Visualization Project: Exploring p5.js and Chart.js

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the capabilities of two popular JavaScript visualization libraries: p5.js and Chart.js. We'll create a Flask-based web application that showcases multiple visualizations of different datasets, highlighting the strengths and unique features of each library.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Visualization Libraries**: p5.js, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Data Format**: JSON

## Datasets to Explore
1. **Climate Data**: Temperature and precipitation trends over time
2. **Population Demographics**: Age distribution and population growth
3. **Financial Data**: Stock market performance visualization
4. **Interactive Art**: Creative visualizations demonstrating p5.js capabilities
5. **Geospatial Data**: Simple mapping visualization

## Visualizations to Create

### With p5.js
1. **Interactive Particle System**: Demonstrating physics-based interactions
   - Features to highlight: Animation, interactivity, custom rendering
   - Implementation: Mouse-driven particle creation and interaction

2. **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Animated bar chart or bubble chart
   - Features to highlight: Custom animations, transitions, event handling
   - Implementation: Visualizing population growth over time with animated transitions

3. **Creative Art Generation**: Generative art based on data inputs
   - Features to highlight: Creative coding capabilities, algorithmic design
   - Implementation: Creating patterns or artwork influenced by dataset parameters

### With Chart.js
1. **Multi-dataset Line Chart**: Climate data over time
   - Features to highlight: Multiple datasets, legends, responsive design
   - Implementation: Temperature and precipitation trends visualization

2. **Interactive Bar Chart**: Population demographics
   - Features to highlight: Hover interactions, data tooltips, animations
   - Implementation: Age distribution visualization with interactive elements

3. **Mixed Chart Types**: Financial data visualization
   - Features to highlight: Combining chart types, customization options
   - Implementation: Stock performance with volume indicators

## Application Structure
- Home page with navigation to different visualizations
- Individual pages or sections for each visualization
- About/Information section explaining the libraries
- Comparison section highlighting differences between p5.js and Chart.js

## Presentation Elements

   - Performance considerations

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - p5.js strengths: Creative coding, animation, custom visualizations
   - Chart.js strengths: Ease of use, built-in chart types, responsiveness
   - When to choose each library

4. **Resources and References**
   - Official documentation
   - Community examples
   - Additional learning materials
